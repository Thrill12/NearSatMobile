# NearSatMobile

An app which will take your coordinates and show you the closest satellite to your current location. It is not yet finished as I would like to add a map on which you can visually
track any satellite from the database.

It uses current TLE data from the official <a href="https://celestrak.com/">Celestrak</a> website and the <a href="https://github.com/1manprojects/one_Sgp4">One_SGP4</a> library to calculate the positions of the satellites.

I would like to expand this to be able to choose which satellite you track by searching for it.
