# NearSatMobile

An app which will take your coordinates and show you the closest satellite to your current location. It is not yet finished as I would like to add a map on which you can visually
track any satellite from the database.

It uses current TLE data from the official Celestrak website and the One_SGP4 library to calculate the positions of the satellites.

It is nowhere near done, as I have exams in the next few weeks, but over the summer I want to possibly expand this program to be able to select which satellite you are tracking, and possibly even build a robotic arrow to point towards the satellite in the sky.
